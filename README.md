# ABE598

This is the work done for the final project for Autonomous Decision Making (ABE598). The scope of the project is to explore path planning algorithms for autonomous systems, in particular RRT and RRT*, and to implement it on a real robot in a simulation engine. One of the contributions of this project is the fully functional open source code for research purposes and for enthusiastic roboticists who do not have access to real physical hardware.
